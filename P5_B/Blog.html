      <h2>Is IPL 2021 giving the Indian T20 World Cup Squad more concerns than answers?</h2>

          The Indian Premier League (IPL) has naturally become the breeding ground for youngsters to find their way into the Indian team in the shortest format of international cricket. <br><br>
          It is justified too, considering that the league tests a newbie’s capabilities in T20 against the best playersin the world in extremely high-stake situations, which isn’t the case really with domestic T20s. <br><br>
          So naturally, once a player has been picked in the international team, a close eye would be kept on their outings in the IPL to make an estimation of their prospective performances for the Blues.
      </p>
      <h3>IPL a big focus in Indian T20 World Cup Squad</h3>
      <p>
         On those grounds, the second leg of the IPL is being widely looked as a preparation stage for the players who have made the cut for India’s World T20 squad later on.<br> <br>
         India’s selection of the squad was quite peculiar, with the team arguably taking a bold approach by hunching on youngsters and spinners who have performed quite well in the last couple of years. <br> <br>
         It also marked a comeback for Ravichandran Ashwin, who hasn’t seen much limited overs action since the fateful loss to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy in 2017. <br>
         However, fans crave for change more than anything else, and hence the performance of the entire Indian squad has been under immense scanner since the beginning of this leg of IPL 2021. <br> <br>
         For starters, concerns have been raised over the form of the Mumbai Indians’ duo of Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan this season. To be fair, both of them were incredible last year and justified their selection in the series against England earlier this year. Back then, they had performed incredibly for players so new to the international stage and made a formidable statement that they were there to stay. <br> <br>
         However, Ishan lost his place in the XI for a period and Suryakumar endured a poor season. It needs to be noted that Mumbai as a collective did not play at their optimum level yet either. <br> <br>

      </p>
      <br> <br>
      To call for Hardik Pandya, a pillar for the Indian team in white-ball cricket, to be replaced by someone as new to the stage as Venkatesh Iyer is simply naïve. Yes, Indian cricket hasn’t made certain surprising decisions in the past. But a competition as big as the T20 World Cup needs to be looked at with much greater perspective than what is being done currently. <br> <br>
      Overhauling the core of the squad just days prior to the commencement of a World Cup is simply unwarranted. These decisions have to be made prior to the squad announcement. There is no use of course correcting once a bullet has been fired. <br><br>
      All the players included in the squad are mighty fine in their own rights. They have performed well for both their IPL teams and the Indian side in the last year or so. One should not let the recency bias cloud the larger picture, especially so close to a tournament so important for the team due to multiple critical many factors. <br><br>

        In the T20 format of cricket in the first six overs, only two fielders are allowed outside the 30 Yard circle. This mandatory period of six overs is known as a power play. The power play signifies the first six overs of the batting teams’ innings. Indian Premier League or IPL is the professional Twenty20 cricket league played in India. Currently, IPL has 8 teams, with IPL played every year the new records are made and one such record is the power play. In this article, the lowest powerplay scores in IPL history is discussed. <br> <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1. Rajasthan Royals- 14/2</strong> <br> <br>
        Rajasthan Royals won the Indian Premier League in 2008, but they haven’t reproduced that feat ever since. The following year, in their match against Royal Challengers Bangalore they confined them to a below-par total of 133/8. In reaction, Rajasthan battled to put bat to ball within the Powerplay, scoring a measly 14 at the cost of 2 wickets. The top 3 of Graeme Smith, Swapnil Asnodkar and Niraj Patel floundered wretchedly in this match. They would have fancied chasing down the target after the destitute show within the Powerplay, but Kumble’s brilliance (5/5) bundled them out for the then most reduced total within the alliance- 58. <br> <br>
        <strong>2. Chennai Super Kings- 15/2</strong> <br> <br>
        Chennai Super Kings have been the foremost reliable side within the history of the association. However, they are known to begin their innings a small conservatively in general. In Kolkata 2011, Brett Lee and Iqbal Abdullah tied down their scoring rate within the Powerplay. Abdullah took the wicket of Murali Vijay, whereas Yusuf Pathan sent back Suresh Raina within the first 6 overs itself. CSK may only manage 114 runs within the 20 overs, as KKR won the diversion by 10 runs [DLS Strategy].<br> <br>
        <strong>3. Chennai Super Kings- 16/1</strong> <br> <br>
        Chennai yet again made it to this list in 2015, as Delhi put up an excellent show with the ball at Raipur. Dwayne Smith and Brendon McCullum opened the batting for the men in yellow. Zaheer Khan and Shahbaz Nadeem bowled tight lines, putting them under pressure as CSK scored only 15 runs. Khan took the wicket of McCullum in the Powerplay overs. CSK could only get to 119, as Delhi won by 6 wickets.<br> <br>
        <strong>4.Kolkata Knight Riders- 17/4</strong> <br> <br>
        Kolkata Knight Riders got to be the group with the least Powerplay score of the IPL 2020 season within the match against Royal Challengers Bangalore at Abu Dhabi. Hyderabad pacer Mohammed Siraj wreaked destruction, taking 3 wickets in 3 overs at the fetched of just 2 runs. Tom Banton hit a four and six of Saini’s over, but Siraj got his wicket within the following over. Saini moreover picked up a wicket, whereas Morris stemmed the flow of runs from one end. KKR finished up scoring 84/8 in 20 overs and lost by 8 wickets <br> <br>
        <strong>5. Chennai Super Kings- 16/1</strong> <br> <br>
        This was the third time ever that Chennai scored at less than 3 runs per over in the Powerplay overs. This came against Royal Challengers Bangalore at Chepauk in 2019 in the first match of the season. CSK rolled over RCB for 70 runs in the first innings on a turning track. However, they also took their time to chase down the target. RCB tried their best to slow down the scoring rate by introducing Yuzvendra Chahal in the Powerplay, who took the wicket of Shane Watson. Chennai ended up chasing the target with 14 balls to spare.<br> <br>
